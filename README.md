# Die-Deutschen-Kleinigkeiten

## Overview
This project was developed for a high school contest. It is a quiz application for German trivia, and it supports 2 languages, namely English and German. A friend of mine used Adobe Photoshop to create a few of the UI elements, he did not contribute in any other way, unless you count the moral support he provided:)

Note: the source code is written in Romanian. It's important to highlight that the code, being one of my earlier works, is notably old and cumbersome. A comparison with my more recent projects showcases the substantial improvements in my coding practices and project development skills.

## Technologies used
- C#
- Windows Forms for the GUI

## Screenshots
**Note: The GUI was not a primary concern during the development of this project.**
